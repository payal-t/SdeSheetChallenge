/*
 * You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of board.
 * 
 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
 cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 A painter will only paint continuous boards. Which means a
 configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
 invalid.
 Return the ans % 10000003
 
 Input :
 K : Number of painters
 T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
 L : A List which will represent length of each board
 
 Output:
 return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003
 Example
 
 Input : 
 K : 2
 T : 5
 L : [1, 10]
 Output : 50
